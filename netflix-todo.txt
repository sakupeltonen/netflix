Task ideas
- for a given user, recommend 5 new movies
    - how to do this concretely: rank all movies and pick 5 with the relatively highest score? or just highest score?
    - how to test the result
    - simple, most general approach: matrix completion problem, i.e. predict the rating value of a user/movie pair
- for a given movie, find 5 similar movies
    - cluster movies?

General
- NODE TO VEC


should just try many approaches:

1. user-based collaborative filtering
- pearson correlation: probably easier to form a table with users as rows and movies as cols, and use pre-defined methods to compute correlations between rows


2. model-based method: latent factor model


evaluate selection (line) in repl: option-shift-p



print tools: 
- for a given user, print a list of rated movies along with the ratings
